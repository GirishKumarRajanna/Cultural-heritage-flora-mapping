Exocarpos cupressiformis,"Lutruwita has five native species of Exocarpus, a member of the sandalwood family. ‘Exo’ means outer, and ‘carpos’ fruit: the seeds are on the outside of the fruit, like cashews and strawberries. These are exceptional trees for several reasons. They are hemi-parasitic, meaning they use the roots of other trees for a water source. This makes them extremely hard to propagate. 
Always look after the trees around the native cherry trees, as they are important for their survival. 
FOOD The red fruits are high in vitamin C; they are delicious. To eat, hold the in-built handle, the outer seed, and bite off the fruit. The brighter, darker red fruits are the sweetest.
MEDICINE The young leaf tips and sap have coagulant properties. They are crushed into a pulp and applied to wounds that are bleeding. The young leaf tips are part of traditional snakebite remedies.

Has roots like potato, an inch long and half an inch thick; four or five. A blue flower like a potato. Roast it.
