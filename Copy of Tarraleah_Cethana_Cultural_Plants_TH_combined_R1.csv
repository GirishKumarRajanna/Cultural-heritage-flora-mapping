Acacia dealbata subsp. dealbata,Silver wattle,"SEASONS When the silver wattle blooms, it signals that wallabies are in their birthing season. Consequently, we need to exercise greater caution when hunting wallaby during this period. Nature’s cues guide us, even in the hunt. After flowering, seeds can be gathered by laying a blanket down and brushing the branches to collect them.
FOOD The sap, when chewed or infused for a beverage, has a taste similar to flavourless chewing gum. As for the seeds, they are harvested either in their green state and subsequently dried, or directly when already dried out. These seeds can be consumed as-is or ground into flour for culinary purposes. 
MEDICINE 
Pollen for sleep enhancement While scientific evidence remains limited, traditional knowledge suggests that incorporating pollen from Acacia flowers into the diet may contribute to improved sleep quality.
Seeds as a hayfever preventive measure Consuming small quantities of seeds – particularly when they are still green – has been associated with mitigating hayfever symptoms and may reduce sensitivity to allergens and alleviate other allergic reactions.
Ash and sap for healing wounds Both ash and sap play essential roles in traditional wound care. When applied topically, ash can act as a natural antiseptic, aiding in wound sterilisation and promoting healing. Similarly, sap possesses soothing properties that facilitate tissue repair and alleviate discomfort caused by burns and sores.
Sap as a remedy for diarrhoea The potential of consuming sap to alleviate gastrointestinal distress is attributed to its mild astringent properties, which may help regulate bowel function.
TOOLS The ash and sap from the silver wattles are heated on the fire, usually in an abalone shell, then combined to make a strong glue.",,Acacia siculiformis,,No information
Acacia leprosa var. graveolens,Varnish wattle,"FOOD The seeds, once dried then ground and cooked, serve as a viable food source. The sap extracted from the varnish wattle is also edible.
MEDICINE The sap possesses wound healing properties and can be applied as a dressing. For hayfever relief, consuming both the flowers and the seeds will alleviate symptoms.
TOOLS The leaves can be effectively employed as a fish poison.",,Ajuga australis ,Australian bugle,"FOOD Flowers are eaten fresh or mixed with flour to make damper.
MEDICINE The leaf is used for mild skin injuries such as cuts, stings and scratches. It is also made into a decoction to bathe sores and boils."
Acacia mearnsii,Black wattle,"FOOD The sap is water soluble and is made into drinks.
MEDICINE Flowers can help to reduce hayfever symptoms (but also cause hayfever in some people), while the gum can be dissolved in water and drunk to prevent diarrhoea and to alleviate indigestion. Bark-infused water can be used as a cough MEDICINE and lotion for skin irritations such as eczema.
TOOLS The sap is mixed with wood ashes in hot water to make a water-tight cement. The inner bark is used for string and the outer bark is good for wooden implements bowls and coolamons, as well as tanning for wallaby, possum and kangaroo skins.",,Balaskion australe,,No information
Acacia melanoxylon,Blackwood,"FOOD The black seeds can be eaten when roasted, dried or ground and mixed with water or animal fats to make damper. This is the 'the seed of the lightwood' Robinson mentioned in his diary on 30 January 1834. (See also Acacia leprosa var. graveolens.)
MEDICINE The bark is heated and rubbed/wrapped on sore rheumatic joints. It can also help headaches, colds and fever.
TOOLS The inner bark fibres are used for fishing line, and the wood for clubs, clap sticks and throwing sticks. The bark may be used as a container/coolamon. The bark is an effective fish poison. The white ash can be used for paint.",,Bellendena montana ,mountain rocket ,MEDICINE UTAS studies suggest possible medicinal uses

Acacia verticillata ,Prickly moses ,"There are also three subspecies in Lutruwita.
FOOD The sap is eaten straight from the tree. The dried seeds are also edible but difficult to harvest due to the spiky leaves.
MEDICINE The sap is applied to wounds to aid healing and keep out infection.
TOOLS The bark is used for string and fishing line.
SEASONS, When the flowers are out, this is a visual reminder that the echidnas are breeding and laying eggs, so we must be more careful when hunting.niyakara  
One day, three hunters went out to catch rraykana/emu for dinner. The cheeky spirit decided he would run between the hunters and the rraykana, so the rraykana could get away. The hunters had to stop trying to catch their dinner and chased after the spirit, but they were too quick. The spirit ran into a big thick bush of raprina, so when the hunters tried to go after the spirit, they got covered in all the prickles. The hunters had to sit down and make a fire to keep warm while they pulled out all the prickles and made a new plan. Before long, the cheeky one came back, running around the fire kicking the hot coals and ashes at the hunters. The youngest hunter had an idea. He decided he would throw the prickles at the spirit, and when the other hunters joined in, before too long the spirit was completely covered in prickles and slowed right down, then changed into trimanya, the echidna. To honour the persistence and courage of trimanya, when raprina is in flower, we do not hunt female trimanya.",,Carpha alpina,,No information

The French naturalist, Ferdinand Péron, who visited Tasmania on the Baudin expedition (1800–1803), noted taking ‘orchid bulbs in bag’ (A voyage of discovery to the southern hemisphere, 1809, vol. 1, p. 193).

FOOD Inside the top of the trunk is a white pithy substance, which can be eaten when cooked, although this does kill the plant. While still curled, the new fronds (croziers) may be cooked in very hot coals and eaten.
These ferns caught the attention of early naturalists. Robinson, Backhouse and Maiden noted their bitter, astringent taste when raw, saying Cyathea was preferred. And Backhouse observed the ‘pith from about 18 inches of the top of the trunk was removed, roasted in ashes’, while Robinson noted that they were ‘eaten with kangaroo. Wedges of charred wood used to split stem; roasting destroys bitterness’ (Plomley, 1991).
CAUTION This plant contains shikimic acid, which is a known carcinogenic. Edible parts of this plant must be cooked at high temperatures to remove traces of the acid. The wood from silver wattle (Acacia dealbata) burns extremely hot and is the preferred fire to cook these ferns.

Holes at the bottom of those trees had been made to receive the juice and which answered the purpose of the tank. Some of the liquor had dried and was white and resembled in appearance and taste a bruised apple; some was brown. It was amusing to see the natives run from tree to tree to suck this juice, of which they are very fond.

Exocarpos cupressiformis,Common native-cherry,"Lutruwita has five native species of Exocarpus, a member of the sandalwood family. ‘Exo’ means outer, and ‘carpos’ fruit: the seeds are on the outside of the fruit, like cashews and strawberries. These are exceptional trees for several reasons. They are hemi-parasitic, meaning they use the roots of other trees for a water source. This makes them extremely hard to propagate. 
Always look after the trees around the native cherry trees, as they are important for their survival. 
FOOD The red fruits are high in vitamin C; they are delicious. To eat, hold the in-built handle, the outer seed, and bite off the fruit. The brighter, darker red fruits are the sweetest.
MEDICINE The young leaf tips and sap have coagulant properties. They are crushed into a pulp and applied to wounds that are bleeding. The young leaf tips are part of traditional snakebite remedies.

Has roots like potato, an inch long and half an inch thick; four or five. A blue flower like a potato. Roast it. Green leaves good to eat.’ While Smith mentions the Aboriginal word that would indicate he was referring to sun orchids, his reference to ‘four or five’ tubers would seem to indicate Caesia, rather than Thelymitra, which has paired tubers.

And Robinson recorded, while in northeast Tasmania, seeing five bundles of dry leaves lashed together for a catamaran. He said the rushes were quite dry (Typha is dry in winter) and 'is the same which they eat' (in Friendly Mission, p. 399).
